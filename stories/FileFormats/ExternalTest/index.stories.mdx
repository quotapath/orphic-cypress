# Defining Tests in an External File

<Story story={stories.ExternalTest} id="external-test" />

In an external file, you could write a test which used composeStories
and cy.mount explicitly. In fact, you could do this entirely without this package.

```tsx
import { composeStories } from "@storybook/react";
import React from "react";
import * as stories from "./index.stories";

const { ExternalTest } = composeStories(stories);

describe("External test file", () => {
  it("should contain the external label", () => {
    cy.mount(<ExternalTest />);
    cy.dataCy("button").should(
      "contain",
      "Will be tested in external .cy file"
    );
  });
});
```

If the stories feature mdx docs according to [this recipe](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md) (although actually you'll want to include the default export and add `includeStories: []` which it hints at), then you'll want to override the `includeStories` in the test file so that `composeStories` can find the proper tests. That is in fact what this ExternalTest is doing.

```ts
// this is necessary b/c stories here have mdx generated docs
delete (stories.default as { includeStories?: string[] }).includeStories;
const { ExternalTest } = composeStories(stories);
```

In the story file, define stories exactly as you normally would, although you may
want to skip automatic test execution.

```ts
export default {
  component: Button,
  // otherwise this would do a mount test like Untested.stories.tsx
  // which would be fine in this case, just redundant
  cySkip: true,
};

export const ExternalTest: ComponentStory<typeof Button> = (args) => (
  <Button {...args} />
);
```

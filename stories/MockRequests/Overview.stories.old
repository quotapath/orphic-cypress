## Further afield

If you really wanted the storybook mock itself to work, you could pull in `decorators` e.g.

```ts
import { decorators } from "storybook-addon-mock/dist/cjs/preset/preview";
SomeStory.decorators = decorators;
```

though I haven't quite found out how you'd make expectations against those mocked requests. Reading from addon channel emit is promising, but didn't quite work and would still present challenges for proper waiting.

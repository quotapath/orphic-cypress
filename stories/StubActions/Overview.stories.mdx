# Stubbing Actions

This library provides tools for automatic action stubbing based on `args`, `argTypes` and the `argTypesRegex`.

See these tests for example uses with various file types and configurations, and [module docs](https://quotapath.github.io/orphic-cypress/functions/actions.stubStoryActions.html)
 for more details

Cypress component test stubs are really slick and the test runner provides a great, interactive interface for debugging

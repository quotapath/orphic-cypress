# Fully Skipped

You can full skip test files via the cySkip property on the default export.
If you need to completely ignore them instead of marking as pending, see
[cyIncludeFiles](/docs/ignoring-via-cyincludestories--not-skipped-function)

```ts
export default {
  component: Button,
  cySkip: true,
};

export const Skipped: ComponentStoryCy<typeof Button> = (args) => (
  <Button {...args} label="Story function" />
);
Skipped.cy = () =>
  cy.dataCy("button").should("contain", "Would fail if not skipped");
```

# Selecting stories with .cyOnly

`cyOnly` property on either the default export or individual stories effectively
calls the cypress test with `describe.only` or `it.only`, restively.

That should be used with caution of course, e.g. actually including something
like these tests would effectively narrow down which tests were running in a major way,
especially in the non-isolated, 'mount' test.

```ts
export default { component: Button };

export const NotSkippedFunction: ComponentStoryCy<typeof Button> = (args) => (
  <Button {...args} label="Story function" />
);

NotSkippedFunction.cy = () =>
  cy.dataCy("button").should("contain", "Story function");

NotSkippedFunction.cyOnly = true;

export const SkippedFunction: ComponentStoryCy<typeof Button> = (args) => (
  <Button {...args} label="Story function" />
);

SkippedFunction.cy = () =>
  cy.dataCy("button").should("contain", "Would fail if not skipped");

export const NotSkippedObject = {
  args: { label: "Another" },
  cy: () => cy.dataCy("button").should("contain", "Another"),
  cyOnly: true,
};

export const SkippedObject = {
  args: { label: "Another" },
  cy: () => cy.dataCy("button").should("contain", "Would fail if not skipped"),
};
```

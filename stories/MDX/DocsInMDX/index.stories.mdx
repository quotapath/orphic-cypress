# Defining Documentation in MDX files

<Story story={stories.DocsInMDX} id="docs-in-mdx" />

The storybook preferred way of writing stories in CSF format but adding documentation in MDX files is to follow [this recipe](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#csf-stories-with-mdx-docs).

For cypress tests purposes, we'll want to include the default export but then add `includeStories: []`, which is a pattern hinted at in that documentation but which must have changed slightly. However, for automatic testing purposes, that will be a problem for `composeStories`. As such, you should add `cyIncludeStories: true` to your default export. For this repo specifically, we don't want to show the component itself in the docs, so we set `parameters.docs.disable` to `true`. All in, the story file looks like this

```ts
import type { ComponentStory } from "@storybook/react";
import * as React from "react";
import { Button } from "../../Button";

// eslint-disable-next-line storybook/story-exports
export default {
  component: Button,
  // mdx generated docs
  includeStories: [],
  cyIncludeStories: true,
};

export const DocsInMDX: ComponentStory<typeof Button> = (args) => (
  <Button {...args} />
);
DocsInMDX.args = {
  label: "Documentation provided by mdx file while component is written in csf",
};
// don't show the component in the docs created by mdx
DocsInMDX.parameters = {
  docs: { disable: true },
};
```

and the MDX file looks like, well..., this file. But here's a snippet:

```tsx
import { Meta, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import * as stories from './index.stories';
import { Button } from '../../Button';

<Meta title="Docs In MDX" component={Button} />

# Defining Documentation in MDX files

<Story story={stories.DocsInMDX} />

The storybook preferred way of writing stories in CSF format but adding documentation in MDX files...
```

See [External Test](/docs/external-test) for another example and one in which the tests are external, and so don't need the `cyIncludeStories` but which will need to override the `includeStories` manually.
